"""Tier 3: the private API. Registered always, usable only with --unofficial.

The tools are always registered so that an agent asking for something official
Instagram cannot do gets a clear explanation instead of "no such tool". Every
one of them fails closed with the reason and the flag needed.

What is deliberately absent, and why, is in safety.NOT_IMPLEMENTED and is
reported by unofficial_status. Follow, unfollow and bulk like are the three
actions that get accounts restricted fastest, and they are what every
growth-hack tool ships. Leaving them out is the positioning, not an oversight.

Writes on this tier need the tier turned on and confirm=true on the call. A
message sent from a private-API session is both the most useful and the most
dangerous thing here.
